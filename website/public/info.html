<p><i>The arXiv discussion takes place every Tuesday and Thursday at 11:15 am in
    the 6th floor lounge of Campbell Hall. See the listing of recent papers <a href="index.php">here</a>.</i>
</p>

<p><i><b>UPDATE:</b> (August 24, 2010) The arxiv discussion page is moving
    to <a href="http://ucb.voxcharta.org">ucb.voxcharta.org</a>. The scripts
    that handle plugin bookmark requests and meeting emails are currently
    disabled. You can follow the instructions below to uninstall the plugin
    and remove the "List for discussion" buttons from arxiv.org.</i></p>

<p><i><b>UPDATE:</b> (March 12, 2010) The new version of Firefox (3.6) breaks
    the previous version of the extension (arxivdiscussion.xpi v0.1.1). This is
    only due to a versioning mismatch and not a code incompatibility. To fix
    the problem, please reinstall the .xpi file in the normal way described
    below. The new version will appear as arxivdiscussion v0.1.2 in the Firefox
    Add-ons panel and should now work for any version of Firefox greater than
    2.0. Please notify Matt George if you have any problems getting this to work.</i></p>

<p>A software tool can be used to modify the way you see the arxiv.org website
  and it's mirrors. This tool adds a button next to each paper that allows you
  to submit them to a local website that lists papers for discussion. You just
  need to copy a file onto your machine and follow the installation instructions
  below, then click on interesting papers. To see how 
  the arxiv.org website is modified when you have the plugin installed, see
  these screenshots with the "List for discussion" button added
  [<a href="screenshot1.png">list page</a>, <a href="screenshot2.png">abstract
    page</a>].
</p>

<p>The plugin is currently not hosted on this website in order to restrict
  access to local users, but once you have it on your machine, it should work
  from anywhere. If you're a local user without an Astro account (e.g., LBL or
  Physics), contact me and I'll email you the file needed
  (mgeorge@astro.berkeley.edu or 751 Campbell).
</p>

<h3>To get the Firefox plugin:</h3>

<p><i>from a local machine:</i> cp ~mgeorge/arxiv/arxivdiscussion.xpi .<br>
<i>from a remote machine:</i> scp
username@lupus.berkeley.edu:~mgeorge/arxiv/arxivdiscussion.xpi .<br>
(you will have to enter your password)
</p>

<h3>Firefox Installation/Uninstallation</h3>
<p>Once you've gotten ahold of the .xpi file, just use Firefox to open it, and
  it will install automatically. Restart Firefox, and you should see buttons
  that say "List for discussion" on arxiv.org listings. Once it's installed,
  you can delete the arxivdiscussion.xpi file. 
</p>

<p>To uninstall, go to Tools->Add-Ons in Firefox, find arxivdiscussion.xpi and
  click Uninstall. You can also just disable the plugin to keep it quiet.
</p>

<h3>To get the Safari plugin:</h3>

<p><i>from a local machine:</i> cp
  ~mgeorge/arxiv/arxivdiscussion_safari.user.js .<br> 
<i>from a remote machine:</i> scp
username@lupus.berkeley.edu:~mgeorge/arxiv/arxivdiscussion_safari.user.js .<br>
(you will have to enter your password)
</p>

<h3>Safari Installation/Uninstallation</h3>
<p>This is a bit more involved than the Firefox installation. First you should
  install <a href="http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php">SIMBL</a>
  (requires root). Second, you should
  install <a href="http://8-p.info/greasekit/">Greasekit</a>. (<strong>Note:</strong>
  The current version of GreaseKit - 1.7 as of 9/25/09 - seems to be having
  problems. Contact Matt George to get an older compatible version.) Then once you've
  gotten ahold of the .user.js file, use Safari to open it, and 
  it will install automatically. While running Safari, if you click on the
  Greasekit menu, "arxiv discussion" should have a checkmark next to it and you
  should see buttons that say "List for discussion" on arxiv.org listings. Once
  it's installed, you can delete the arxivdiscussion_safari.user.js file.
</p>

<p>To disable the plugin, click on the Greasekit menu and select arxiv
  discussion so that the checkmark next to it is removed. To uninstall, go to
  Greasekit->Manage scripts, select arxiv discussion in the left panel and
  click the Uninstall button. 
</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>
<p>The point is to minimize the barrier for participation in the arXiv
  discussion. There was a previous method to submit papers for discussion by
  using a wiki on bSpace. But you had to enter a password each time, and bSpace
  sucks, so it fell into disuse. Now while you're browsing astro-ph, if you see
  an interesting paper, you can just tag it and it will be
  listed <a href="index.php">here</a>. Hopefully more people will bring in more
  papers, we all can learn about a diverse set of topics, and everyone benefits.
</p>

<p>Additionally, if everyone can see what papers others have found interesting
  in advance,
perhaps they will read them before the meetings to enable a more engaging
discussion (i.e., don't look at the listing and think, "great, someone else
tagged it so they can explain it to me and I won't have to bother reading it.")
</p>

<h3>Support</h3>
<p>Contact Matt George (mgeorge@astro.berkeley.edu, 751 Campbell)
with any issues. The plugin currently only works in
Firefox and Safari, with only a couple of recent versions tested. If you want
  to see something for Chrome, Opera, etc. or other features let me know.
</p>

<h3>Known issues that might be fixed in the future</h3>
<ul>
<li>currently only tested on opensuse and OS X (let me know your results if
  you're using something different)</li>
<li>it doesn't work for older papers (pre-April 2007) where the paper identifier
  format was different</li>
<li>could add buttons to search results pages on arxiv.org (e.g., when looking
  at the list of all papers for an author)</li>
<li>less mangling of special characters</li>
<li>add buttons to ADS, Nature, Science?</li>
<li>individual paper libraries?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The Firefox (Safari) browser plugin is based on
  a <a href="http://www.greasespot.net/">GreaseMonkey</a>
  (<a href="http://8-p.info/greasekit/">Greasekit</a>) script which calls a 
  local page written in PHP that in turn parses the paper metadata from the
  <a href="http://export.arxiv.org/api_help/">arxiv API</a> using
  the <a href="http://simplepie.org/">SimplePie</a> library and maintains a
  database built with <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>. The style
  sheet for the paper list page was stolen
  from <a href="http://arxiv.org">arxiv.org</a>, 
  with the header color scheme appropriately modified. Thanks to OSU's
  Astronomy Coffee for the initial idea and to James Graham of Cambridge for an
  earlier implementation in Python.

<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>No identifying information is stored from the browser plugin or while
  submitting papers for discussion. IP addresses are stored upon visiting the
  submitted paper list in order to gauge use of the website.
